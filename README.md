# Smart Electric Metering System BackEnd
# # Smart Electric Metering System Backend

## Overview

The Smart Electric Metering System Backend is designed to log and optimize power usage, specifically tailored for the Nigerian consumer power sector. Developed by Makinde T.I, Abu A.O, and Adenekan A.A, this backend system serves as the core component for managing and analyzing electricity consumption data.

## Features

Power Optimization: Provides insights and tools to help users optimize their power usage.
Real-Time Data Processing: Efficient handling and processing of smart meter data to enable real-time analytics.
Data Logging: Efficiently records electricity consumption data from smart meters.
User Authentication: Implements secure user authentication mechanisms.
API Endpoints: Offers a set of API endpoints for seamless integration with frontend applications and other systems.
Robust Error Handling: Comprehensive error and exception management to maintain system stability.
Scalability: Designed with best practices in mind to support future expansion and increased data loads.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

Authentication: Contains modules related to user authentication and authorization.
Context: Defines the database context and configurations.
Contracts: Houses interfaces and abstract classes that define the contracts for implementations.
Controllers: Contains the API controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
Entities: Defines the data models and entities used in the system.
Implementations: Includes concrete implementations of the contracts and business logic.
Interfaces: Contains interface definitions for dependency injection and abstraction.
Migrations: Stores database migration files for version control.
Models: Houses data transfer objects and view models used across the application.
Properties: Contains project-specific properties and settings.
